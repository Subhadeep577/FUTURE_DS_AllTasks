# 📊 College Event Feedback Analysis – Task 3 (Future Interns Internship)

This repository contains my official submission for **Task 3** of the **Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics Internship**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze student event feedback data, uncover meaningful insights, and provide recommendations for enhancing the quality of future college events.  


## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. Perform **data cleaning & preprocessing** to ensure accuracy and consistency in the dataset.  
2. Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns in student responses.  
3. Generate **interactive visualizations** to showcase distribution, sentiment, and event ratings.  
4. Perform **sentiment analysis** on feedback comments to classify opinions (positive, neutral, negative).  
5. Present **key insights, recommendations, and summary findings** for stakeholders.  


## 🛠️ Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the dataset for analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) to explore rating distributions, feedback sentiment, and event participation trends.  
- **Visualization:** Multiple charts and word clouds to make insights more engaging.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Text analysis of comments to gauge overall student perception.  
- **Reporting:** Creating structured outputs in both Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and Markdown (`.md`) formats for submission.  


## 📊 Key Insights

- ✅ Students are **highly satisfied overall** – majority ratings fall between 4 and 5.  
- 📌 **Workshops and seminars** consistently earned the highest ratings, showing demand for skill-focused events.  
- ⚠️ Some **negative feedback** pointed towards logistical and coordination issues.  
- 💡 **Improvements needed:** Time management, better event scheduling, and more interactive sessions.  


## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Rating distributions (histogram & countplot)  
- Average rating by event type (bar chart)  
- Sentiment distribution (pie chart)  
- Word cloud of comments  
- Trend analysis of event feedback


## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud, nltk)  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**  
- **Markdown & GitHub** for reporting and documentation
