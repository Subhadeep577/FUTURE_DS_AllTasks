# ðŸ“‘ Task 3 Report â€” College Event Feedback Analysis

**Intern Name:** Subhadeep Kumar Sahoo  
**Internship Program:** Future Interns â€“ Data Science & Analytics Internship

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This project analyzes student feedback collected after college events (workshops, seminars, cultural activities) to understand attendee satisfaction and highlight areas for improvement. The analysis combines numerical ratings and textual comments to produce a balanced view of event performance. Core deliverables include a reproducible Jupyter Notebook, summary mini-report, and this detailed report.

---

## 2. Project Objectives

- Preprocess and clean survey data exported from Google Forms.  
- Explore rating distributions and event-level performance.  
- Classify and summarize textual feedback via sentiment analysis.  
- Create professional visualizations suitable for stakeholder presentation.  
- Provide actionable recommendations based on data-driven findings.

---

## 3. Data & Methodology

### Dataset
- Format: CSV (Google Forms export compatible)  
- Core fields: `ResponseID`, `Timestamp`, `Event`, `Department`, `EventType`, `Rating`, `Comments`

### Preprocessing Steps
1. Convert `Timestamp` to datetime where applicable.  
2. Fill/standardize missing comment fields.  
3. Validate and clip ratings to the 1â€“5 scale.  
4. Remove duplicate responses by `ResponseID` when present.

### Analysis Flow
- **EDA:** Descriptive statistics, rating histograms, per-event averages, and response counts.  
- **Sentiment:** A demo lexicon-based sentiment label (Positive/Neutral/Negative). For production, switch to VADER/TextBlob.  
- **Visualization:** Countplots, bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds to summarize findings.

## 4. Exploratory Findings (sample walkthrough)

> Note: Replace these example observations with your dataset outputs after running the notebook.

- **Rating distribution:** Most respondents submitted ratings of 4 or 5, indicating high overall satisfaction.  
- **Top events by average rating:** Skill-based workshops and hands-on sessions tend to rank highest.  
- **Events with lower ratings:** Some seminars with long Q&A or poor audio arrangements scored lower.  
- **Sentiment alignment:** Numeric ratings generally correlate with comment sentiment; however, outliers exist (e.g., high rating but negative comment about logistics).

---

## 5. Textual Feedback Analysis

- **Word Cloud & Frequent Words:** Frequent positive terms â€” *great, helpful, interesting*. Frequent concerns â€” *long, boring, timing, noisy*.  
- **Quick manual review:** Negative comments often refer to logistics rather than content quality (venue, sound, overcrowding).

---

## 6. Recommendations

1. **Improve logistics:** Prioritize time management, seating, and audio-visual checks before events.  
2. **Increase interactivity:** Add hands-on sessions and live Q&A to maintain engagement.  
3. **Targeted follow-ups:** For low-rated events, conduct targeted short-form follow-ups to capture the cause.  
4. **Stronger sentiment pipeline:** Adopt VADER/TextBlob or transformer-based models for more reliable text analysis.  
5. **Dashboard:** Build a lightweight dashboard (Streamlit/Power BI) for real-time event monitoring.

---

## 7. Limitations

- The notebook includes a demo sentiment lexicon; it is not a replacement for validated NLP tools.  
- If the dataset is small, statistical significance may be limited.  
- Synthetic sample data is included for demonstration. Replace with real responses for final stakeholder reporting.

## 8. Deliverables

- `notebooks/College_Event_Feedback_Analysis_Final.ipynb` â€” reproducible analysis notebook  
- `data/student_event_feedback.csv` â€” sample dataset (replace with real CSV)  
- `reports/Mini_Report_College_Event_Feedback_Final.md` â€” short summary for stakeholders  
- `reports/Report_Task03.md` â€” this detailed report

---

## 9. Appendix
